# the-verification-of-Monty-Hall-problem

a visual chart about the verification of Monty Hall problem


This program aims to test the monty hall problem and
give a visual chart for better understanding.

First, you will be asked to input 2 positive integers which are 
the time of each trial and the time of total trail. If what you input 
is not a positive integer, the program will ask you to do so again.

Then, a chart will be generated automically by the program.

The probability of choosing the reward when you change you decision is two times
higher than the porbability of choosing the reward when you do not change.
In other words, p1 = 2/3 p2 = 1/3
